# Map Panda

###### Project Overview

[Map Panda](https://mappanda.com) grabs the user's location with the [Geolocation API](http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html), and through the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/) a selection of popular location types are available to explore. The [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/) and [Uber](https://developer.uber.com/) APIs are leveraged to provide further functionality to the application.
